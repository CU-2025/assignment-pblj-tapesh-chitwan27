Assignment_PBLJ: The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

    src: the folder to maintain sources
    lib: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the bin folder by default.

    If you want to customize the folder structure, open .vscode/settings.json and update the related settings there.
